Comparator allows us to sort the collection using different fields


Serializable

i. Serializable interface is a marker interface which is used to serialize and deserialize the java object.
ii. Serialization is a mechanism of converting object into byte-stream.
iii. Deserialization is a reverse process where byte-stream is converted to the real java object.



Static and Default Methods in interface
Using Static and Default methods we can write non-abstract methods inside a interface.
Static method will be declared with the Static keyword and default methods are defined using a default keyword.



MARKER INTERFACE
Marker interface is a empty interface with no method which is used to mark the interface to provide the additional information about an object
to JVM and Compiler.
There are some examples like
i. Serializable
ii. Cloneable (The clone() method is inside the object class)


COMPARABLE INTERFACE
Comparable interface provides a single sorting sequence that means we can sort the collection on the basis of single element such as id, name, and price.

COMPARATOR INTERFACE
sorts collection on the basis of multiple elements
