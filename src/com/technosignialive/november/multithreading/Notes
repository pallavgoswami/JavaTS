Multithreading is the process of executing multiple threads simultaneously or in parallel.
A thread is a lightweight sub process, the smallest unit of processing.

Daemon Thread
Daemon thread is a low priority thread which is used to provide services to user thread such as memory cleaning.
If user threads are terminated, JVM will terminate daemon thread forcefully.
The best example of daemon thread in Java is garbage collector.

List of methods in thread class
What is the difference between wait and sleep method?
What is the difference between notify and notifyAll method?
What will happen if we call yield method on a thread?

Which method are from Thread class, String class and Object class?

List out all the methods present in the object class

YIELD
    Yield Method allows the other thread to execute which has same priority.
    However it does not guarantee that the current thread will stop executing.
    It puts the current thread back to the ready to run state (Runnable state) and not in Sleep or Waiting state.

WAIT
    It causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes notify or notifyAll method on the same object.
    It releases the lock on the object and enters the Waiting state.
    wait(); -> Wait until notified
    wait(2000); milliseconds -> Wait for the specified time before continuing if not notified
    It causes the current thread to sleep for a specified amount of time without releasing the lock.

NOTIFY
    Notify method will notify to a single thread which is waiting on the object.

NOTIFYALL
    This will notify all the threads which are waiting on the object.
