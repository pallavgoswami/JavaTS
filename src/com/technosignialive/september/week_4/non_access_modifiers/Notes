Non Access Modifiers
- They are also used with class, constructors, variables and methods and static class.
- They are:
1. static
2. final
3. abstract
4. synchronized
5. volatile
6. transient
7. native

1. Static
    i. Static is a keyword and is a non-access modifier which is used with class, variable, method and static block

2. Static Variable
    i. If we declare any variable as a static, then a single memory of static variable will be created and shared among all the objects.
    ii. We can call or access static variable using class name.

3. Static Block
    i. Static Block is used to initialise static data members and static block will get executed before main method.
    ii. Multiple static blocks can be written an d will be executed from top to bottom.

4. Static Method
    i. If we declare any method as a static then it is called as a static method.
    ii. Static method can be called without using object of a class.
    Q1. Why we don't declare each and every method as static in java?
    A1. We donâ€™t declare all methods as static because it breaks object-oriented principles like encapsulation and polymorphism. Non-static methods allow operations on instance-specific data, ensuring flexibility and proper design.
        Static methods cannot be overridden.
